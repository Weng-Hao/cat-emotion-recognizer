## "Prohibition of Commercial Use Statement"
#### Introduction
This document serves as an official declaration and detailed explanation regarding the prohibition of commercial use of the content, materials, and resources provided by [Your Name/Entity]. It is essential for all users to understand and strictly adhere to the terms outlined herein to avoid any unauthorized activities that could lead to legal consequences and damage the integrity of the original purpose of these offerings.
#### 1. Definition of Commercial Use
Commercial use refers to any activity that is intended to generate revenue, profit, or gain a competitive advantage in a business or for-profit context. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:
- Selling or reselling: Using the content to create products or services that are then sold to customers. For example, incorporating our text, images, or designs into merchandise such as T-shirts, mugs, or books and selling them for a profit.
- Advertising and marketing: Utilizing the materials to promote a business, brand, or product. This could involve using our videos or infographics in advertising campaigns, on company websites, or in social media promotions to attract customers and drive sales.
- Business operations and services: Implementing the content as part of a business's core operations or service offerings. For instance, a consulting firm using our research reports or templates to provide advice to clients and charge fees for those services.
Licensing or franchising: Obtaining the rights to use the content in a commercial licensing agreement or as part of a franchise model to expand a business and generate income.
#### 2. Reasons for Prohibition
There are several important reasons why commercial use is strictly prohibited:
- Quality and integrity maintenance: The content provided is intended to be used for non-commercial purposes such as education, personal interest, or non-profit initiatives. Allowing commercial use could lead to misrepresentation, misinterpretation, or misuse of the materials, which would compromise their quality and the message they convey. For example, if our educational articles were used in a commercial training program without proper context or adaptation, it could result in inaccurate information being disseminated to participants.
- Protection of intellectual property rights: The creators of the content have invested time, effort, and resources in its development. By prohibiting commercial use, we can better protect our intellectual property rights and ensure that the value of the content is not exploited for someone else's financial gain without proper authorization and compensation.
- Fairness and equality: Allowing commercial use would create an uneven playing field for businesses and individuals. It would give an unfair advantage to those who can afford to use the content for profit, while those who are using it for legitimate non-commercial purposes would be at a disadvantage. For example, a small non-profit organization that uses our resources to raise awareness about a social issue would be competing with a for-profit company that uses the same resources to sell related products, which is not a fair competition.
#### 3. Allowed Uses
While commercial use is prohibited, the following non-commercial uses are generally permitted:
- Personal learning and self-improvement: Individuals can use the content to expand their knowledge, develop new skills, or pursue personal interests. For example, a student can read our articles to enhance their understanding of a particular subject, or a hobbyist can watch our tutorials to learn a new craft.
- Educational institutions: Schools, colleges, and universities can use the content for teaching and learning purposes, as long as it is not part of a for-profit program. For example, a teacher can use our materials in a classroom lecture, or a library can make our resources available to students for research.
- Non-profit organizations: Non-profit organizations that are registered and operate for charitable, educational, or social welfare purposes can use the content to support their mission and activities. For example, a non-profit environmental organization can use our infographics in their awareness campaigns to educate the public about environmental issues.
However, even in these allowed uses, proper attribution must be given to the original source, and the content should not be modified in a way that changes its original meaning or intent.
#### 4. Consequences of Violation
Any violation of the prohibition of commercial use will have serious consequences:
- Legal action: We reserve the right to take legal action against individuals or entities that engage in unauthorized commercial use of our content. This may include seeking injunctions to stop the infringing activities, claiming damages for the losses caused by the infringement, and pursuing other legal remedies available under applicable laws.
- Reputation damage: Unauthorized commercial use can also damage the reputation of the violator. If a business is found to be using our content without permission for commercial purposes, it may face negative publicity, loss of customer trust, and damage to its brand image.
- Loss of access: We may also terminate the access of the violator to our content and resources, and take steps to prevent them from using our materials in the future.
#### 5. How to Request Permission for Commercial Use
If you have a legitimate need to use our content for commercial purposes, you can request permission by following these steps:
- Submit a formal request: Send a written request to [weng_jia_hao@ruc.edu.cn] clearly stating the purpose of the commercial use, the specific content you want to use, and the scope and duration of the use.
- Provide detailed information: Include information about your business, such as its name, address, and contact details, as well as the nature of the commercial activity you plan to undertake using our content.
- Wait for approval: We will review your request and may grant permission if we determine that the proposed use is appropriate and does not violate our policies. If permission is granted, we will provide you with a written agreement outlining the terms and conditions of the use, including any fees or royalties that may be required.
